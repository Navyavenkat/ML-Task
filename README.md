# Task=-1
# Implement a Simple Linear Regression Model
# Algorithm
# Step-1
   Load the dataset and preprocess the data.
# Step-2
   Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
# Step-3
   Implement a simple linear regression model using libraries like scikit-learn.
# Step-4
   Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the
testing set using appropriate metrics
# Step-5
    Visualize the regression line along with the actual data points using
matplotlib or any other suitable visualization library.

# Output
